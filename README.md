I build **clean, rule-driven backend systems** with a strong focus on **correctness, ownership enforcement, and predictable system behaviour**.

I enjoy working close to the core of systems — designing APIs, enforcing business rules, modelling data correctly, and making sure backends behave safely under all conditions.

> I value **clarity, maintainability, and correctness** over flashy features.

## 🧠 What I Focus On

- API-first backend design (Postman-driven)
- Service-layer authorization (no magic frameworks)
- Ownership-driven business rules
- Explicit lifecycle & state transition enforcement
- Relational data modelling with SQL-heavy systems
- Defensive validation and predictable error handling
- Writing backends that are easy to debug, reason about, and explain

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Enterprise Project & Task Management Backend  
**Java · Spring Boot · MySQL · JPA · Thymeleaf**

An **enterprise-style backend system** designed to manage long-lived projects and tasks with **strict ownership enforcement and lifecycle control**.

**What this project demonstrates:**
- Service-layer authorization ensuring only resource owners can create, modify, archive, or restore projects and tasks
- Strong business rule enforcement preventing invalid operations on archived or immutable entities
- Soft-delete (archive / restore) strategy to preserve historical data and audit safety
- Optimized read-heavy APIs using DTO projections, pagination, sorting, and custom JPQL
- Centralized exception handling for safe, predictable failure behaviour
- Minimal Thymeleaf + Bootstrap UI to demonstrate backend-to-UI flow (all logic server-side)

### 🔹 API-First Issue Tracking Backend  
**Java · Spring Boot · MySQL · JPA · Postman**

A **pure API-first backend** focused on REST correctness, ownership enforcement, and defensive error handling.

**What this project demonstrates:**
- No UI by design — Postman used as the client
- Clean REST APIs with explicit HTTP semantics
- Service-layer authorization without JWT or Spring Security
- Explicit issue lifecycle management  
  `OPEN → IN_PROGRESS → RESOLVED → ARCHIVED`
- Soft delete using ARCHIVED as a terminal, immutable state
- Pagination, sorting, filtering, and DTO-based JPQL projections
- Comprehensive Postman test collection covering success, failure, and edge cases
- Global exception handling for consistent, predictable error responses
