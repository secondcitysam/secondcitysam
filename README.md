# Hi, I’m Samyak Kedari 👋

Backend-focused Java developer with a strong interest in building **clean, rule-driven backend systems** using Spring Boot.

I enjoy working close to the core of systems — designing APIs, enforcing business rules, modelling data correctly, and making sure systems behave predictably under all conditions.

I care more about **correctness, maintainability, and clarity** than flashy features.

## 🧠 What I Focus On

- API-first backend design
- Service-layer authorization (without relying on magic frameworks)
- Explicit state management and lifecycle rules
- Relational data modelling with MySQL
- Defensive validation and centralized error handling
- Writing backends that are easy to reason about and explain

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Enterprise Project & Task Management Backend
**Java · Spring Boot · MySQL · JPA · Thymeleaf**

An enterprise-style backend system designed to manage long-lived projects and tasks with **strict ownership enforcement and lifecycle control**.

Key highlights:
- Service-layer authorization ensuring only resource owners can create, modify, archive, or restore projects and tasks
- Strong business rule enforcement preventing invalid operations on archived or immutable entities
- Soft-delete (archive / restore) strategy to preserve historical data and audit safety
- Optimized read-heavy APIs using DTO projections, pagination, sorting, and custom JPQL
- Centralized exception handling for safe, predictable failure behaviour
- Minimal Thymeleaf + Bootstrap UI to demonstrate backend-to-UI flow while keeping all logic server-side

### 🔹 API-First Issue Tracking Backend
**Java · Spring Boot · MySQL · JPA · Postman**

A pure **API-first backend** focused on REST correctness, ownership enforcement, and predictable system behaviour.

Key highlights:
- No UI by design — Postman used as the client
- Clean REST APIs with explicit HTTP semantics
- Service-layer authorization without JWT or Spring Security
- Explicit issue lifecycle management  
  (OPEN → IN_PROGRESS → RESOLVED → ARCHIVED)
- Soft delete using ARCHIVED as a terminal, immutable state
- Pagination, sorting, filtering, and DTO-based JPQL projections
- Comprehensive Postman test collection covering success, failure, and edge cases
- Global exception handling for consistent error responses

⭐ If you’re a recruiter or engineer reviewing my profile:
I’m interested in backend roles where **correctness, ownership, and clean system design** matter more than UI polish.
